What is Merge Insertion Sort?
Merge insertion sort is a special way of sorting numbers that tries to use the fewest possible comparisons (asking "is this number bigger than that number?"). It was invented by Ford and Johnson in 1959.
What is the Jacobsthal Sequence?
The Jacobsthal sequence is a series of numbers that goes: 1, 1, 3, 5, 11, 21, 43, 85, 171...
Each number is found by: next number = 2 × previous number + the number before that
For example: 3 = 2×1 + 1, then 5 = 2×3 + 1, then 11 = 2×5 + 1
How Does This Help with Sorting?
Think of sorting like organizing your Pokemon cards from weakest to strongest. The Jacobsthal sequence tells the algorithm the best ORDER to insert cards into your sorted pile.
Here's why it's special:

Smart Insertion Order: Instead of just adding cards one by one from left to right, the Jacobsthal sequence gives us a "magic order" that requires fewer comparisons.
Binary Search Optimization: When you want to find where a new card belongs in your sorted pile, you can use binary search (checking the middle, then half of that, etc.). The Jacobsthal sequence chooses numbers that make this binary search work most efficiently.
Minimizing Worst Cases: The sequence is designed so that even in the worst-case scenario, you'll never need more comparisons than absolutely necessary.

A Simple Example
Let's say you have 5 numbers to sort. Instead of inserting them in order 1,2,3,4,5, the Jacobsthal-based approach might insert them in order 1,3,2,5,4. This special order means you'll need fewer "is this bigger than that?" questions to get everything sorted.
